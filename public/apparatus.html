							<p>Many spacecraft flew out of Earth's orbit. To do this, they were gaining a second space speed.</p>

							<p>At the beginning of 2015, not a single spacecraft left the vicinity of the Earth at a third cosmic speed. The New Horizons spacecraft had the highest rate of leaving the Earth; this speed was 16.26 km / s (heliocentric speed 45 km / s), which is 0.34 km / s less than the third cosmic one. But due to the gravitational maneuver near Jupiter in 2007, he added 4 km / s, which will allow him to confidently leave the heliosphere in the future. At the end of the main part of their mission (exploration of Pluto), New Horizons were moving away from the Sun at a heliocentric speed of about 14 km / s. Other spacecraft that had already left the heliosphere (Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11) accelerated in a similar way. All of them left the vicinity of the Earth at speeds significantly lower than the third cosmic one.</p>

							<p>There are no vehicles that have exceeded the fourth space.</p>

						<p>Voyager 1 was launched on September 5, 1977, passed Jupiter in March 1979, and reached Saturn in November 1980. Voyager 2 was launched earlier, on August 20, 1977, on a slower trajectory, and it flew past Jupiter in July 1979, past Saturn in August 1981, flew over Uranus in January 1986, and Neptune in August 1989.</p>
						<p>The peculiarity of the trajectories of these space probes is that at the time of launch, the location of the outer planets of the solar system allowed the intensive use of perturbation maneuvers. Thanks to maneuvers in the gravitational field of giant planets, spacecraft were able to fly around the planets and go beyond the heliosphere with minimal fuel consumption to accelerate.</p>
						<p>It should be noted that when NASA officially confirmed Voyager's entry into interstellar space outside the heliosphere on September 12, 2013, a significant number of media outlets erroneously announced that the spacecraft had gone beyond the solar system. In fact, the latter can only happen when Voyager announces a complete change in the direction of the magnetic field outside the heliosphere. This could happen around 2027.</p>
